# AI-Resume-Matcher
AI-Powered Resume Screening and Job Match System

# Project Statement
The hiring process in modern organizations faces significant challenges due to the overwhelming volume of resumes recruiters receive for every job opening. On average, a recruiter spends 7 seconds reviewing a resume, often leading to missed opportunities for identifying the best-fit candidates. Furthermore, the mismatch between resume content and job requirements results in inefficiencies, prolonged hiring cycles, and increased costs. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of scalable tools that can analyze and match resumes to job descriptions with precision.

This project addresses this gap by developing an AI-Powered Resume Screening and Job Match System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to revolutionize how resumes are screened. By automating resume parsing, extracting key qualifications, and matching them against job requirements, the system ensures faster, fairer, and more accurate hiring decisions. Additionally, the interactive web app will empower recruiters with real-time candidate rankings, saving time and resources while enhancing the candidate experience.

# Objectives
## Automate Resume Parsing and Job Description Analysis:

Develop an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to extract and structure key information from resumes (like skills, experience, qualifications, education) and job descriptions (like required skills, roles, qualifications).
Implement named entity recognition (NER) and text classification to parse resumes and job descriptions with high accuracy, ensuring a deeper understanding of both.

## Match Resumes to Job Descriptions Using Machine Learning:

Build a machine learning-based scoring system that compares the content of resumes against job descriptions to rank candidates based on their relevance.
Leverage models like BERT to compute semantic similarity, focusing on the contextual meaning of job requirements and resume content.

## Develop a User-Friendly Web Application:

Create an interactive web interface using Streamlit where recruiters can upload resumes and job descriptions, and receive ranked results based on candidate suitability.
Implement real-time feedback where recruiters can adjust weighting factors (like prioritizing skills over experience) and instantly see changes in the ranking.

## Provide a Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard:

Include an analytics dashboard that visualizes key metrics, such as the skill gap between job descriptions and resumes, skill frequency, and a ranking of resumes by overall suitability.
Provide recommendations on candidate fit and areas where they may need further skill development.

## Optimize the System for Scalable, Real-World Use:

Build a backend system that can handle large datasets (thousands of resumes and job descriptions) efficiently using cloud computing and data storage solutions using AWS.
Ensure scalability by implementing an architecture that allows for easy integration into existing HR systems, making the tool applicable for enterprises of all sizes.

## Implement Continuous Learning and Improvement:

Enable the system to learn and improve over time by collecting feedback from recruiters on candidate ranking accuracy and automatically adjusting model parameters.
Introduce active learning techniques to improve model performance by incorporating human feedback into the training process.

## Deploy a Fully Functional Model and Web Application:

Deploy the AI model and web application using cloud platforms like Heroku(As AWS is not a free tier), ensuring easy access and availability for recruiters.
Provide documentation and detailed usage instructions for non-technical recruiters to easily integrate and use the platform.
